## Last Week's Accomplishments

Not much was accomplished last week since most of my time last week was invested into
ProgLang and Game Dev 1.

## This Week's Plan

Setting up a proper development environment so that progress towards the most basic features
can be performed.

## Anything Blocking?

"Creating an OS is the most difficult challenge any programmer can take" - OSDev Wiki

There are a lot of obvious roadblocks currently, aside from inexperience, there is a lack
of knowledge in general, hence why a lot of our previous work is contained within research.
