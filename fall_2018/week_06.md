## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I tried to fix the issues with my dev envinronment with little success. I may try switching
to a new dev environment.

## This Week's Plan

After attempting to fix my issues with the dev environment, I plan on making sure I fully understand the code
base that is being used. We are moving towards finishing the code base that will allow us to work entirely in
C as opposed to assembly.

## Anything Blocking?

Relearning dev tools is going to be a setback for me personally. Outside of that, I also need to catch up
to where a couple of the other team members are at.
