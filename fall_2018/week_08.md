## Last Week's Accomplishments

The cross compiler is now setup, so we should be able to start writing code in C which will speed up our work
by a significant amount. We hope to complete some kind of echo terminal by Friday that we can show as a demo.

## This Week's Plan

This week we're making time for a long hacking session which will be directed towards creating a terminal
which can show both input and output.

## Anything Blocking?

After we make some significant progress towards something we could show off as a demo, we're not 100% sure
what to work on next. After we finish our proof of concept terminal, we're not really sure what is next.
