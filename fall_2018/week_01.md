## Design #######

The majority of work being done for BASA.os currently is in research and design.
Currently what is being worked on is the bare bones of the OS. We made the decision
to use an already existing bootloader for simplicity. The remainder of our work time is 
invested in individual research about the processes and requirements for a simple 
kernel.
