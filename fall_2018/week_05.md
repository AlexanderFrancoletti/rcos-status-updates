## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I worked on setting up the dev environment so that we can begin testing bootloaders
and load binary files.

## This Week's Plan

Continue to look into bootloaders and work on writing a code base that we can extend when moving
on from bare bones. Test dev environment so that I can guarantee I will be able to test everything.

## Anything Blocking?

My main os was having issues installing the tools I had planned on using for development. My virtual
linux box was able to install just fine, but that VM has some major memory and slowdown issues that
I can't fix, so I may need to look into different tools for dev testing.
