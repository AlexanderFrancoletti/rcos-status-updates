## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week research was done towards finding a better guide for setting up the dev environment
along with finding an overall more comprehensive starting point for our basic architecture.

## This Week's Plan

Look into bootloaders and decide how we are going to load our operating system. The current
plan is to use an already existing bootloader, we just need to decide which one and test it.

## Anything Blocking?

A lot of our group members had a ton of work in the past week, so lack of time was an issue
for the past 2 weeks. We still have a lack of experience, but our main focus currently should
be something a bit easier for us to look into.
