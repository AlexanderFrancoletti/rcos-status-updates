## Last Week's Accomplishments

In the past week I was dealing with several final projects and meetings for final projects, so I didn't have 
much time to commit to this project. I pulled some changes in from the gdb branch, but outside of that I didn't
contribute much to the project last week.

## This Week's Plan

Expand on the printing functionality I already have implemented by including printing in different colors along
with implementing VGA drivers so that we can work on implementing some kind of terminal.

## Anything Blocking?

Still waiting on keyboard drivers to be implemented to the extent they are needed, I may try to implement them 
myself if they aren't finished by a certain point this week.
