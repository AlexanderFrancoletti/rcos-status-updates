## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we had our large group presentation. We mostly showed our knowledge gained as a result of our
research and the tools we've been using. Also wrote a basic print function which I will be extending to include
additional parameters. Didn't do much over Thanksgiving.

## This Week's Plan

Extending the print function I wrote to potentially include things like color. Possibly extend to other output
operations or adding drivers.

## Anything Blocking?

Currently waiting on the keyboard drivers to be finished so we can work through input and potentially have
something similar to an echo terminal.
