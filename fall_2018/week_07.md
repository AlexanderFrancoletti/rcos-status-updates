## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I fixed my dev environment, and attempted to get caught up with my group, since I had fallen behind
as a result of other classwork along with the aforementioned dev environment problems.

## This Week's Plan

I still need to get caught up in terms of knowledge with the rest of the group, and I will have significantly
more time to do so this week than I did last week. Current plans are to get caught up and then try to work on
implementing an echo terminal as a starting point for our os.

## Anything Blocking?

Lack of knowledge of the code base and assembly currently written is going to be the biggest timewaster for me
in the next week.
