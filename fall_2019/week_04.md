Week_04
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Setup a basis for 2 players to play against each other. Right now this is just a setup for 2 controllable characters
that can both damage and combo each other. The controls are a little off because there isn't currently a controller
setup or anything, and there are a couple weird bugs that I need to look at. 

## This Week's Plan

Setup the win screens, a better system for 2 players to play vs each other, possibly a simple AI that can play vs
a human and a way to differentiate player vs cpu and player vs player.

## Anything Blocking?

A few instances of weird behavior came up while trying to duplicate the original character into the second player
spot, so I want to figure out why those things came up.
