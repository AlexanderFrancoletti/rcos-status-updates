Week_07
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Working version of blocking currently, however it's very crude and there isn't anything I would consider to be
proper gameplay yet, but it does exist. Fixed up some inconsistency things with the projectiles, added some extra
win scenes, and made characters face the correct direction for a visual on blocking.

## This Week's Plan

Add a simple AI that I can use to play against for testing purposes. The AI should be able to attack, block,
move, and use specials.

## Anything Blocking?

Adding an AI opponent to fight is going to take a bit of effort, but I have created simple game AI before
and this shouldn't be too hard.
