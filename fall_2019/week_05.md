Week_05
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added some additional UI functionality for combos and began work on a system for blocking attacks. Haven't tested
yet but this may take me a few weeks to get working. Fixed the weird behavior that showed up during testing in the 
last 2 weeks.

## This Week's Plan

Continue working on a primitive blocking feature, not going to worry about different types of attacks until I get
blocking to work in the simplest fashion possible.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm not sure how I'm supposed to implement blocking in my current system. From a game design perspective, there has
to be significant reward for being aggressive otherwise players are incentivised to do nothing. Likewise, the defense
can't be bad, otherwise the game won't feel like it rewards skilled play or encourage good decision making. What this really
means is that I have no idea how to balance defense while also making it function properly.
