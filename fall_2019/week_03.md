Week_03
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished the functionality for the health bars and add a time condition to decide on the winner of the
match. Currently if any of the win conditions are met for either character it will send to the player 1
win screen, which is fine for now.

## This Week's Plan

Setup a basis for 2 players to play against each other. This could include setting controls while playing,
creating a simple AI to play against a single player, setting up all the win screens, and setting player 2 to 
be a functional character.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to clean up some things with movement to make the game feel more correct in terms of how the characters
should move in the air and on the ground.
