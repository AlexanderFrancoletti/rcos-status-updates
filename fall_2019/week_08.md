Week_08
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Bug fixing and reimplementing the special projectile move. Looked into adding an in game control scheme, but
it seems like it would require me to make significant changes to my current architecture to implement so I
may not get to it. Created a design for an AI that should be able to play vs the player.

## This Week's Plan

Add a simple AI that I can use to play against for testing purposes. The AI should be able to attack, block,
move, and use specials.

## Anything Blocking?

I really wanted to add a menu system for setting buttons while the game is going but it turns out that unity
doesn't really have a nice way to do that innately.
