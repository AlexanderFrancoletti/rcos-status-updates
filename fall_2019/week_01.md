Week_01
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Created new proposal for the fall 2019 semester. Looked back at design docs and set plans for the following
semester. However, I am potentially going to be changing the project to a new one.

## This Week's Plan

Decide between the returning to the current 2D fighting game project or moving to a new project about
creating and implementing a physics engine. Going to look up some potential resources for physics
engines and then decide.

## Anything Blocking?

Really unsure what I want to do this semester, can't decide on whether I would prefer to continue on
Beyond the Grave or start writing my own physics engine.
