Week_08
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Setup a base for move and animation cancelling on hit and added a simple combo counter
that logs comboes moves to the console. Can distinguish comboed moves from non-comboed moves
by adding a hitstun component. Cleaned up a lot of animation related bugs.

## This Week's Pln

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Add final attack options - Special/Feint
	Add more moves that are used in combination with directional input
	Add other move canceling options and states

## Anything Blocking?

Currently nothing in particular is keeping development from moving forward except for a lack
of art assets since I need to make more of those for new moves.
