Week_09
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Setup presentation demo and presented the current version of the project. Cleaned up some bugs
and mostly focused on making sure that everything in the demo worked as intended.

## This Week's Pln

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Add more moves that are used in combination with directional input
	Add other move canceling options and states
	Extend move list to include special and feint buttons

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing in particular is blocking. I have an idea for how to implement feint and I need to extend
the assets to allow for more move creation.
