Week_11
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added feint and special buttons, created additional animations for the feinted attacks, made
changes to the animator to allow special moves and feinted moves to work properly. Added projectile
logic and projectile prefabs.

## This Week's Pln

Things I want to accomplish next:
	Add animations and additional move effects
	Create a simple AI for testing states
	Add blocking, crouching, knockdown states

## Anything Blocking?

Having limited controls disables me from easily testing components of the game that would require
input from 2 different players/controllers without building an AI to play against.
