Week_03
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Didn't accomplish much last week because I spent a lot of time working on other projects. One project however has
some good functionality for this project that I can reimplement to make collisions from forces more solid. I did
look into the player class but I don't have anything significant to show for it.

## This Week's Plan

I may push back the deadline for a basic player class because I have a lot of tests, homework, and presentations
in the following week, so I don't know if I will accomplish anything before Thursday or Friday next week. However
I should have time to do significant work on the project over break.

## Anything Blocking?

Same issues as last week with game dev 2 project needing more attention than this project, along with significant
refactoring in that project. Next week is looking really rough with a psych test, opsys hw, gd2 presentation on
Monday through Wednesday.
