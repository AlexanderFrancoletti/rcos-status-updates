Week_04
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Setup the animator for playing animations when desired, and also added a basic sprite for the player and an
animation for a single punch. The animator state machine is working as intended currently and I now understand
how to go about creating more animations, implementing them, and allowing them to transition properly.

## This Week's Plan

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Create a hitbox manager that will place hitboxes through an animation
	Add more animations so that I can work on other potential transitions such as canceling moves into each other

The player class should be finished or close to finished this week.

## Anything Blocking?

Ran into some issues with the animator that have been resolved. Also ran into the realization that the free use 
sprite sheets I imported would either require reslicing and resizing for use or they wouldn't work properly with
Unity's sprite slicing, which was a minor setback.
