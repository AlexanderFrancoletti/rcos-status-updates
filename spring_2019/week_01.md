Week_01
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Began design documents and fleshed them out to a significant degree. Worked on a separate unity 2d project and
looked at some tutorials for how unity 2d works.

## This Week's Plan

Flesh out the design documents a little bit more and begin work on a character class that can be extended to
multiple characters. Most likely will just be something along the lines of a test scene with some debug hitboxes
that are on multiple buttons.

## Anything Blocking?

Being a single member on a team essentially working from scratch is going to make this slightly slower than I
had hoped, but I don't expect that it will slow me down that much since I no longer have to worry about redoing
work from merging changes.
