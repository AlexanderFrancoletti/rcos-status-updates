Week_06
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Implemented new hitbox managers in the simplest way possible by creating new managers for each move.
Expanded the animation state machine to include air attacks and some properties for future moves.
Added more animations.

## This Week's Plan

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Create additional states for hitstun, blockstun, crouching, etc.
	Add behavior for hitbox collision that will enable combo/cancel/block mechanics

The player class will be a finished prototype when the new attacks are implemented.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing technical is blocking progress currently, as I have a plan for how to implement blocking, crouching,
damage, etc. The only weird things I can think of to implement are chaining moves together, the feint option,
and what to do for implementing special moves.
