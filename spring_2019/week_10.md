Week_10
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added a move that is used in combination with directional input. That move can also be cancelled with
a jump input, eventually that move will launch the opponent in an upwards direction. Added additional
documentation for adding new moves.

## This Week's Pln

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Extend move list to include special and feint buttons
	Add animations and additional move effects
	Create a simple AI for testing

## Anything Blocking?

Animations taking a decently long time to create is the most time consuming part of the current 
process for adding new functionality.
