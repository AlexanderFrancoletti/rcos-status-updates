Week_05
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Created a hitbox manager and have a general idea for implementing new attacks and specifying when to play each.
Added hitboxes to a spawned animation and have a plan for work flow in the future for creating new attacks.

## This Week's Plan

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Add more animations so that I can work on other potential transitions such as canceling moves into each other
	Create a distinction between move types so I can begin to implement the custom mechanics of the game (feint, special)

The player class will be a finished prototype when the new attacks are implemented.

## Anything Blocking?

Resolved some issues with animation events not being called correctly, which was a major issue for the last
week. One thing I'm not sure about how to implement properly is the feint option, but I have a resource intensive
solution in mind.
