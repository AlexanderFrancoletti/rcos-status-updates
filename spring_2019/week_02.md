Week_02
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished up the core design documents and added a few intermediate due dates. Player scripts have been started
but are not in a finished spot yet. There are some issues with the movement calculation that are causing some 
unintentional effects that will need to be resolved.

## This Week's Plan

Flesh out the player class to the point where everything feels good and has minimal bugs. Get to the point where
I am working on figuring out how to properly create hitboxes and hurtboxes and allowing them to interact.

## Anything Blocking?

My game dev 2 project taking priority over this project most of the time is the biggest reason why I can't devote
my full attention to this project. However, since both projects are using the same engine and require similar levels
of control from the player, a lot of the work for the projects can be reused in some ways.
