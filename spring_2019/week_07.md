Week_07
=======

## Last Week's Accomplishments

Implemented and fixed and issue with hurtboxes/hitbox overlap. Figured out a way to set moves as
multihit. Added a list of states in each player controller but they don't do anything currently.
Added some prefabs and setup a super basic gamemanager for game logic. Beginning of combo system
exists.

## This Week's Pln

Things I want to accomplish this week:
	Setup a combo system, which requires more work on the hitlag/hitstun state
	Differentiate sequential hits from true combos

## Anything Blocking?

I'm not quite sure how animation canceling will work as that is the basis for how combo/move canceling
works in fighting games currently, and also the basis for how hitboxes are generated for the player.
I need to do a bit of research there.
